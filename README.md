# POC Frontend

This repo is a next.js project - Its pretty basic with just the components to build a POC of a eth auth pattern. Its more of a test client to prove an api, kind of.

### Installing

I use nvm to keep node versions inline. You can install it here: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

To get started, run:

- `nvm use`
- `npm i`

### Running in dev

`npm run dev`
This starts the project up in dev mode, with hot reloading. No need to restart the server to see changes.

> By default the app runs on `http://localhost:3000`
